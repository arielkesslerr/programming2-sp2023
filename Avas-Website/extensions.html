<h3 class = "extensions-title">Types of Lash Extensions Offered</h3>

<ol id = "ordered-list-styling5">
	
	<li>Classic Extensions: Classic extensions involve attaching a single extension fiber to each natural lash. This technique provides a natural and enhanced appearance, adding length and thickness to your lashes while maintaining a subtle look.</li>

	<li>Volume Extensions: Volume extensions involve attaching multiple thinner lash extensions to each natural lash, creating a fuller and more dramatic effect. This technique is ideal for those who desire a glamorous, voluminous look.</li>

	<li>Hybrid Extensions: Hybrid extensions combine both classic and volume techniques. This method offers a balance between a natural look and added volume, as it incorporates single lash extensions along with a few fan-shaped extensions for extra fullness.</li>

	<li>Mega Volume Extensions: Mega volume extensions are perfect for those who desire intense drama and maximum volume. This technique involves attaching multiple ultra-fine lash extensions to each natural lash, creating a bold and striking appearance.</li>

	<li>Colored Extensions: If you're looking to make a statement or want to experiment with different looks, colored extensions are a fun option. They come in various shades and can be applied in combination with classic, volume, or hybrid techniques.</li>

	<li>Pre-made Fans: Pre-made fans consist of multiple lash extensions already fanned out and ready to be applied. They save time during the application process and are available in various styles, such as 2D, 3D, or even higher volumes for a full, voluminous effect.</li>

<p class = "fills-title">Lash Fills</p>
	<ol id="ordered-list-styling6">
		
<li> Time Interval: The pricing for lash fills can vary depending on the interval between appointments. Most lash technicians recommend getting fills every 2-3 weeks to maintain the desired lash look. If you wait longer between fills, more time and effort may be required to restore the fullness, which can affect the pricing.</li>

<li> Fill Options: Lash studios typically offer different fill options based on the condition of your lash extensions. Here are a few common options:

<li> Mini Fill: A mini fill is a quick touch-up appointment designed to replace any lost or outgrown lashes. It usually takes around 30 minutes to an hour and is less expensive than a full fill.</li>

<li> Standard Fill: A standard fill involves replacing lashes that have shed naturally or outgrown. This fill option is recommended for clients who have maintained their lashes well and don't require significant additional work.</li>

<li> Extended Fill: An extended fill is a more extensive touch-up that may be necessary if you have lost a significant number of lashes or if it has been a longer time since your last fill. It involves adding more lash extensions to restore the desired fullness.</li>

<li> Pricing Range: The cost of lash fills can vary depending on factors such as the location, salon/studio, and the number of lashes that need to be replaced. Generally, lash fill prices range from $50 to $150 or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. It's best to inquire with your lash technician or the salon/studio about their specific fill pricing.</li>
