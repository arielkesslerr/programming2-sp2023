<span class = "arrow2">&#8594;</span>
<h2>Steps/The Process...</h2>
	<ol id = "ordered-list-styling">
		<li>Preparation: The technician will start by cleansing the client's lashes to remove any makeup or oils.

		<li>Application of a lifting solution: A silicone pad or shield is placed on the eyelid, and the technician applies a lifting solution to the client's lashes. This solution helps to break down the bonds of the lashes, allowing them to be reshaped. </li>

		<li>Lash lifting: The technician carefully uses a lash tool to lift and curl the lashes onto the silicone pad or shield. This step helps create the desired shape and curl. </li>

		<li>Setting solution: After the lashes are lifted, a setting solution is applied to the lashes to help them hold their new shape. The setting solution typically needs to stay on for a specific amount of time determined by the product used. </li>

		<li>Optional lash tinting: If desired, the technician may apply a lash tint to enhance the color and definition of the lashes. This step is optional and can be omitted if the client prefers a natural look.</li>

		<li>Removal and finishing touches: Once the lifting and setting solutions have done their job, the technician removes the solutions and gently cleanses the lashes. Any excess products are carefully wiped away, and the silicone pad or shield is removed. The technician may then apply a nourishing serum or lash conditioner to promote lash health and hydration.</li>
	</ol>

<h4 id = "title-styling-lifts">Lash Tints</h4>

<p id = "ordered-list-styling2">

Lash tints, also known as eyelash tinting, is a beauty treatment designed to darken and enhance the appearance of the eyelashes. It involves applying a special dye to the lashes to give them a darker color, making them look fuller and more defined.

Here's some information about lash tints:

Procedure: During a lash tinting session, a trained aesthetician or beauty professional will cleanse the eye area to remove any makeup or oils. They will then apply a protective gel or pad under the eyes to prevent the dye from getting onto the skin. The dye, usually a semi-permanent color, is carefully applied to the lashes using a small brush or applicator. The dye is left on for a short period of time, typically 10 to 15 minutes, and then carefully removed. The result is darker, more noticeable lashes.

<h5 id = "title-styling-lifts2">Benefits of Lash Tinting and Lifts</h5>

<ol id = "ordered-list-styling2">

<li> Enhanced appearance: It gives the lashes a darker color, making them stand out without the need for mascara or other eye makeup products. </li>

<li> Convenience: With lash tinting, you can wake up with darker lashes and skip the daily application of mascara.</li>

<li> Definition: Tinting can help provide definition and shape to the lashes, making them appear fuller and more prominent.</li>

<li> Water-resistant: Lash tinting is typically water-resistant, so it won't smudge or run, even when exposed to water or sweat.</li>
</ol>

<h6 id = "title-styling-lifts3">Maintenance of a Lash Lift/Tint</h6>

<ol id = "ordered-list-styling2">
	<li>Avoid wetting the lashes: For the first 24 to 48 hours after the treatment, it's important to keep your lashes dry. Avoid wetting them or exposing them to steam, water, or any moisture. This allows the lifted and tinted lashes to set and maintain their shape.</li>

	<li>Be gentle with your lashes: Treat your lashes with care to prevent any damage or premature lash loss. Avoid rubbing or pulling on them, as this can weaken the lashes or cause them to fall out.</li>

	<li>Avoid oil-based products: Oil-based makeup removers, cleansers, and skincare products can weaken the lash lift and cause the tint to fade faster. Opt for oil-free or water-based products when removing eye makeup or cleansing the eye area.</li>

	<li>Avoid mascara and eyelash curlers: With a lash lift and tint, you may not need to use mascara or eyelash curlers as frequently. Mascara can clump the lashes together and cause them to lose their lift. If you still prefer to use mascara, choose a water-based or lash extension-safe formula and apply it sparingly to the tips of the lashes.</li>

	<li>Use a lash conditioner: To keep your lashes healthy and nourished, consider using a lash conditioner or serum. These products can help strengthen and hydrate the lashes, promoting their overall health and appearance.</li>

	<li>Schedule touch-up appointments: The effects of a lash lift and tint can last around six to eight weeks, depending on individual factors. To maintain the desired look, consider scheduling touch-up appointments every few weeks or as recommended by your lash technician.</li>

</ol>

<p class = "formula-title"> Lash Tint Formulas Offered </p>
