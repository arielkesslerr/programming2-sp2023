<h1>PORK DUMPLINGS RECIPE...</h1>

<p>Dumplings can seem intimidating but they aren’t difficult to make. I admit they do take a bit of time to make (like wonton soup or any kind of filled dumpling really) but following the steps below anyone can do it!

These really are the best dumplings without a huge list of fussy ingredients (most are things you know)! No need to buy packages of things you’ll never use again.

Fresh ginger adds lots of flavors while ground pork flavorful adding just the right amount of moisture to the mixture. Customize the filling with whatever you’d like!</p>
<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>

<ul>
<li>PORK:
Ground pork is my favorite dumpling filling but of course, you can use other ground meats as well. Choose one with a mild flavor so you don’t overpower the other flavors in the filling. I’ve made this recipe with ground chicken successfully as well.</li>	
<li>
CABBAGE:
Cabbage adds bulk and texture to the mixture. My choice is napa cabbage but if you don’t have any, you can use coleslaw mix as well. Mix the cabbage with salt and let it sit, this will release all of the water. Next, squeeze out as much water as you can.	
</li>
<li>FLAVORS:
Fresh ginger (and garlic) costs very little and adds heaps of flavor to stir fries, egg rolls, and more! If I have extra, I sometimes toss it into the freezer whole and grate it right from frozen for recipes and soups.</li>
<li>
DUMPLING WRAPPERS:
I personally like to purchase the wrappers since it saves a step but you also make wrappers at home. If purchasing, be sure you’re getting wrappers for dumplings, not wontons as wonton wrappers are thinner.

<p>PORK FILLING</p>
<ol>
	<li>Toss cabbage with salt and set aside.</li>
	<li>Combine the rest of the filling ingredients (per recipe below).</li>
	<li>Squeeze liquid from the cabbage, chop finely, and add to the filling mixture.</li>
	<li>Set out wonton wrappers and place a scoop of filling in the center of each wrapper.</li>
</ol>
<p>HOW TO FOLD DUMPLINGS</p>
<ol>
<li>The best way to prepare the dumplings is to fold one edge over the filling.</li>
<li>Moisten the bottom edge and then crimp the edges to seal the dumpling.</li>	
<li>Be sure not to over moisten the wrapper. This will help it to hold its shape!</li>
</ol>
<p>HOW TO BOIL THE DUMPLINGS</p>
<ol>
<li>To boil dumplings, fill a large pot two-thirds of the way with water. </li>	
<li>Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
<li>Add as many dumplings as can fit comfortably in a single layer in the pot and cook them until they float.</li>
<li>Let them cook an additional two to three minutes.</li>
