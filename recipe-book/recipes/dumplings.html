	<div class = "introduction"> Dumplings can seem intimidating but they aren’t difficult to make. I admit they do take a bit of time to make (like wonton soup or any kind of filled dumpling really) but following the steps below anyone can do it!

	These really are the best dumplings without a huge list of fussy ingredients (most are things you know)! No need to buy packages of things you’ll never use again.

	Fresh ginger adds lots of flavors while ground pork flavorful adding just the right amount of moisture to the mixture. Customize the filling with whatever you’d like!</div>

		<ul class= "unordered-list-styling">
			<div class = "header">INGREDIENTS:</div>
				<li>PORK:
				Ground pork is my favorite dumpling filling but of course, you can use other ground meats as well. Choose one with a mild flavor so you don’t overpower the other flavors in the filling. I’ve made this recipe with ground chicken successfully as well.</li>	
				<li>
				CABBAGE:
				Cabbage adds bulk and texture to the mixture. My choice is napa cabbage but if you don’t have any, you can use coleslaw mix as well. Mix the cabbage with salt and let it sit, this will release all of the water. Next, squeeze out as much water as you can.	
				</li>
				<li>FLAVORS:
				Fresh ginger (and garlic) costs very little and adds heaps of flavor to stir fries, egg rolls, and more! If I have extra, I sometimes toss it into the freezer whole and grate it right from frozen for recipes and soups.</li>
				<li>
				DUMPLING WRAPPERS:
				I personally like to purchase the wrappers since it saves a step but you also make wrappers at home. If purchasing, be sure you’re getting wrappers for dumplings, not wontons as wonton wrappers are thinner.	
				</li>

		<li>Moisten the bottom edge and then crimp the edges to seal the dumpling.</li>
