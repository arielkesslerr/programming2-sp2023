	<div class="introduction">Adding more plants to meals is always at the top of my menu planning, and summer’s bounty makes it even easier to do. With a hot grill already fired up for grilled chicken, fish, or kebabs, I love slicing up fresh vegetables and tossing them on the grill for a simple mezze-ish platter side. Even more, grilled vegetables are a healthy vegetarian main. Grill then chop them up for this favorite healthy pasta salad (with avocado!), or add them to healthy Mediterranean grain bowls, or turn them into this easy grilled veggie sandwiches slathered with ricotta cheese. Grilling coaxes out every bit of deep, roasted, sweetness from any plain old veg. The concentrated heat brings out a lush, smoky char to each addicting bite.

	<div class = "header">INGREDIENTS:</div>
		<ul class = "unordered-list-styling">
			<li>Zucchini — green or yellow work perfectly, cut into ⅓″ to ½″ slices before grilling—cut too thin and they’ll fall apart.</li>
			<li>Bell peppers, poblano peppers, jalapeño peppers sweet baby peppers, shishito peppers — slice bell peppers and remove seeds of the bell peppers before grilling for easiest eating.</li>
			<li>Portabello mushrooms or large brown mushrooms — no need to slice the mushrooms, grill them whole. Start the mushrooms gill side down then finish cap side down to hold in moisture.</li>
			<li>Eggplant — grilled is my favorite way to eat eggplant, where it becomes tender, creamy, and smoky</li>
			<li>Carrots — grilling quickly softens carrots and makes a pretty tiger-striped presentation</li>
			<li>Onions — any variety including green onions become oh so sweet when grilled</li>
			<li>Asparagus — fatter asparagus cooks more evenly than skinny and won’t fall through the grates</li>
			<li>Corn — cooking corn doesn’t get easier than this…see my complete grilled corn tutorial here.</li>
			<li>Cauliflower — slice as steaks so they hold together</li>
			<li>Broccoli — slice as steaks or grill in florets</li>
			<li>Romaine lettuce — this recipe is totally unique but oh so good</li>
			<li>Tomatoes — best grilled only if halved or grilled whole, watch them as they tend to explode and leak</li>
		</ul>

	<div class = "header"> STEPS:</div>
		<ol class = "ordered-list-styling">
			<li>Slice the vegetables the same thickness so they cook at the same rate. I use a handheld mandoline to make my zucchini, eggplant, and onion slices perfectly coordinate. I aim for slices that fall somewhere between ⅓″ and ½″ — I can’t do math so I eyeball it. Slicing the veggies too thin will  make them too tender as and disintegrate on the grill.</li>
			<li>Put oil on the vegetables before grilling. Follow the golden rule of grilling: oil what you grill, not the grill itself. Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil then spread it evenly with your fingers. The mushrooms will absorb the oil quickly so work fast but don’t fret too much about them, they’ll produce plenty of their own juice.</li>
			<li>Season simply. Sprinkle the vegetables somewhat generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. They will absorb the salt as they cook, enhancing their inherent sweetness. Feel free to add dried herbs such as oregano, mint, tarragon, or basil if you’d like.</li>
			<li>Grill ’em up hot. Start your veggies over medium heat, about 350°F to 450°F. Lay long slices and asparagus or carrots crosswise over the grates so they don’t fall through. Close the grill lid and cook the vegetables undisturbed, flipping after 3-5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Close the lid. Closing the lid of your grill creates the same environment as an oven, baking the vegetables as they lightly char. Check their progress every few minutes and cook until softened and the vegetables have your preferred amount of char.</li>
